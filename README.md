# What do I need to know?
I believe there are three main topics that make a great data scientist: Programming, Mathematics/Statistics, and Domain Knowledge.

## Programming
The first thing that comes to most minds when data science is mentioned is coding. Below is a list of resources that I use and have seen voiced in the community. Personally I have used freecodecamp and datacamp the most for my personal development.

### Books
http://rafalab.dfci.harvard.edu/dsbook/
This is one of the first books you should read to get into data science. It covers the basics of R and dives into how to use it in terms of data science. Plus it is free!

## Mathematics
While you can do a fair bit of data science and analysis without math, you will ultimately come to a point where you find it important to have a strong grasp on some critical areas of math. Among these areas are algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics. Besides that, it can only be more helpful to pursue other aspects of math to further your analytical mind. Below are some resources including books, videos, and articles to help you.

### Videos
Among my favorite math youtube channels is The Math Sorcerer.

## Domain Knowledge
Among the three categories, domain knowledge is the most wide-ranging. It encompasses not only expertise in your specific field but also understanding the broader domain of data science itself. Essentially, domain knowledge refers to your understanding of a particular industry or discipline. It's important to note that even programming and mathematics can be considered as forms of domain knowledge, as they are foundational skills required regardless of your specialization. Below, I'll provide a list of resources to help enhance your domain knowledge, covering both general and domain-specific areas.
